# SchedMeet
SchedMeet is a web-application that was built using React (Typescript) and FastAPI (Python) to allow users to schedule events. The app aims to simplify the most tedious parts of scheduling events that may occur such as creating new events that are in different timezones, showing other participants when you are free in their timezone, and lastly showing users in real-time any changes in availability that may have occurred. The application was built with both Postgres as well as DynamoDB where the differences between a SQL and NoSQL database will be compared.
